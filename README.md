# Machine Learning A-Z AI-R 

Machine and deep learning Algorithms in Python (ipynb, py), R, R-markdown, html format. 

1. The Python code in ipynb and py format and the datasets are contained in a separate repository at: https://github.com/samalkani/Machine-Learning-A-Z-AI-Python-R

2. The R code in R files and R-markdown format and the datasets are contained in the R folders within 
the different section folders below

3. The html files for R programs are contained in a separate repository so you can look at the R source code and the output it generates to give a comparison to the Jupyter notebook output you can see in this repository the link to that repository is given here: https://github.com/samalkani/Machine-Learning-A-Z-AI-R-HTML-. The R programs and their output in html format can be viewed in a web browser after downloading the html file from GitHub.

4. The datasets for the code are under the individual folders for R and Python, except for CNN because the 
storage for the photos folder to construct the CNN model were too large to be included on GitHub
